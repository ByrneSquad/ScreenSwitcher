# ScreenSwitcher
A quick app to easily turn off/on duo monitors without having to go through windows display settings

***** Be sure to run through 64-bit python instead of the 32-bit version *****

I created this process for primarily my use at home. I run dual monitors off of my desktop where one monitor is also connected to my xbox.
I wanted a way where I could turn off my 2nd monitor so I could switch the feed to my xbox while keeping a monitor free for my PC. This way I could browse the internet and play xbox at the same time. There is a way to do this through the display settings in the control panel of windows 10 but I wanted a way to circumvente that route with something more custom to my needs.

In my experience Python excels in the concepts of abstraction. There seems to be a library I can import to do just about anything I want. This program is good example with me using the functionalities already built in through the operating system. I am familiar with the classic DOS commands which I was able to pull into this python code.

I made a quick GUI so I can press buttons to switch between the dual screen and single screen options with the help of another library.
